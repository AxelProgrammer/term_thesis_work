Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science dedicated to
creating machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human
intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.
In recent years, AI has made significant strides, and its growing impact on various
aspects of our lives is becoming increasingly evident. From recommending the next
movie to watch on Netflix to suggesting which route to take on Google Maps, AI is
revolutionizing the way we interact with technology.
